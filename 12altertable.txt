alter table is used for
*adding column
*modifying column
*dropping column
*renaming column

adding column
>alter table employee add name varchar(20);
the new column always added the last 
you can also add many column at a single alter command
>alter table employee add(sno number(3),age number(2),city varchar(10));

modify is used to modify the data type of the column.
if you modify a column then make sure that the changes is compatiable with the data as well.ex:if a column have varchar(20) data type and also it have some values then
you cannot modify it into numeric type.because such strings cannot convered into numbers.but you can modify it in to varchar(10).but in this case if that column
have value which have more then 10 characters then it will show error.

drop column
>alter table student drop column salary;
if you this all the feild are dropped and the memory of the table released.when you use big server then you drop a column then a big amount of date will delete,and
column will delete and then table will be modify so it take more to delelte so at that time we use set and unuse option like,
>alter table student set unused column salary;
>alter table student set unused (rollno,name);
in this in logically that column is not in the table but the memory is not released.if you want to drop all unuse column then,
>alter table student drop unused columns;
drop table
>drop table student;
in this case the data and also the structure of the table will be dropped.

truncate is also under the DDL command.so it cannot to rollback.

	or
>alter table old_name rename to new_name;
this is used to rename the table.
>alter table student rename column sno to stdno;
this used to change the column name sno to stdno in student table.
